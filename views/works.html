    <h1>Cryptanalysis of the Enigma</h1>
    <p>
      Cryptanalysis of the Enigma ciphering system enabled the western Allies in
      World War II to read substantial amounts of Morse-coded radio
      communications of the Axis powers that had been enciphered using Enigma
      machines. This yielded military intelligence which, along with that from
      other decrypted Axis radio and teleprinter transmissions, was given the
      codename Ultra.

    <h1>Turing test</h1>
    <p>
      The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in
      1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior
      equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed
      that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between
      a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The
      evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a
      machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The
      conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer
      keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machine's
      ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell
      the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.
      The test results do not depend on the machine's ability to give correct
      answers to questions, only how closely its answers resemble those a human
      would give.
